# About Annette Axon

Annette Axon is the business process management system integrated with project management system. Annette Axon helps companies to define, execute and control their non-project and project business processes.

The BPM engine helps employees to collaborate in organization and project teams during executing company’s business processes. It is based on BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a graphical representation standard developed and maintained by Object Management Group. This standard is intended for specifying business processes in a business process model. The system uses BPMN 2.0 to specify business workflow. In spite of BPMN, the system uses DMN (Decision Model and Notation) and CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation) for decision making and execution of business processes with fuzzy logic.

The Project system is intended to help companies to plan, manage and control their projects. The project stores project data such as work breakdown structure (WBS), project team, documents related to project etc. The work breakdown structure can be represent as Gantt diagram with its original structure and also can be structured using WBS attributes. The BPM engine is used in Process system to execute business processes related to certain project or WBS-element of the project.

The system provides multiple organizational structures that represent  organizational structures of one or more companies and project teams. BPM engine uses these organizational structures as a definitions of individual and group roles that could be used in business processes to assign user tasks to certain user or group of users.

The Forms service helps business analytics to define configurable and flexible forms that are used as means of entering user data in business process user task, project’s work breakdown structure (WBS) etc. The forms defined in Forms service could use one or more data sources connected to certain data providers to visualize and input data.

The Knowledge service is used to store, aggregate and manipulate user data that used in BPM engine and Process system. Knowledge service uses Data Type Repository to declare flat and hierarchical data structures. These data structures can be used by Knowledge service to store user’s data, BPM engine, Forms service and Project system to manipulate user’s data.

The Content Management Service is intended to store user’s files such as documents, spreadsheets, photo and video content etc.

The Search Service helps users to search content in the system. It indexes almost all business object (BPM schemas, projects, WBS elements, users etc.) in the system. Users can use Search service to search business objects across the system.

The Authentication and Authorization services are used to implement user authentication and fine-grained access control.
